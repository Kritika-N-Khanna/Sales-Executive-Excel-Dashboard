# Sales-Executive-Excel-Dashboard  
📊 Sales Executive Performance Dashboard

An interactive and dynamic Excel dashboard built to monitor and analyze sales executive's performance across multiple regions. This dashboard includes macros, VBA automation, slicers, charts, and region-wise navigation to enhance user experience and drive actionable insights.


📝 Project Description  
This Excel-based dashboard visualizes sales performance data across various cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, and others. The dashboard includes multiple views: executive-wise total sales, target hit percentage, deviation from targets, and visual comparisons through bar, pie, and line charts.

To create the dataset, synthetic sales data was generated using Python (Pandas) in a Jupyter Notebook. The final dashboard was developed in Excel using PivotTables, conditional formatting, slicers, and custom **VBA macros** to enable seamless interactivity.

PivotTables & Charts for visualization  
Slicers for region-wise filtering  
Conditional formatting for highlighting key data  
**VBA Macros** for navigation and automation  
**Python (Pandas)** – For synthetic data generation and preparation  
**Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** – For the data creation pipeline  
**File Formats** – `.xlsm` for the macro-enabled dashboard, `.ipynb` for code
